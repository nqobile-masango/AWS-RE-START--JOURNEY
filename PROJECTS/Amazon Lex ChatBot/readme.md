### AWS Lex Interactive Ec2QuizBuddyChatbot Project

### Introduction

In this project, we designed and built an interactive chatbot using Amazon Lex as part of the AWS re/Start Special Projects programme (Praesignis). Our goal was to explore how conversational AI works in practice and to create a chatbot that feels natural, useful, and engaging for users.

The project was completed in two phases:

   * Part 1: Creating a basic chatbot to understand the fundamentals of Amazon Lex
   * Part 2 (Challenge): Expanding the chatbot into a quiz-based learning tool using conditional logic.

### Project Overview

- We built an Amazon Lex chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user input and respond in a structured and meaningful way. The chatbot was designed to guide users through both informational and quiz-style conversations.

- By the end of the project, we had a working solution that demonstrates how chatbots can be used as simple, interactive learning tools, especially in cloud education environments.

### What We Set Out to Achieve

Through this project, we aimed to:

- Understand how Amazon Lex handles intents, utterances, and responses
- Design clear and logical conversation flows
- Build an interactive quiz that responds differently based on user input
- Test and improve the chatbot through hands-on experimentation

### Project Breakdown

*Part 1: Building the Basic Chatbot*

We started by creating a simple chatbot to get comfortable with the core features of Amazon Lex.
What we did:

   - Created an Amazon Lex bot using English (ZA) as the language
   - Defined a single intent focused on Amazon S3
   -  Added common user phrases (utterances) the bot should recognize
   -  Configured a clear and helpful response
   - Built and tested the chatbot in the Lex console

### Part 2: Quiz Chatbot (Challenge)

- After building the basics, we extended the chatbot into a quiz-based experience.
  
### Scenario

- We worked through a fictional client scenario where an educational startup, Cloud Learners Inc., needed a chatbot that could test learners’ knowledge of Amazon S3 in an interactive way.
---

### Quiz Experience

- The quiz chatbot was designed to:

   - Ask multiple-choice questions in a clear format
    - Accept answers such as A, B, or C
    - Give immediate feedback for correct and incorrect responses
    - Guide users smoothly through the quiz without confusion
    
### Quiz Question

### Skills Demonstrated

Through this project, we demonstrated:

   - Chatbot design and conversational flow planning
    - Logical thinking using conditional branching
    - Understanding of conversational AI principles
    - Problem-solving and testing skills
   - Clear technical communication and presentation ability
---

### Testing and Validation

- We tested the chatbot using the Amazon Lex test console by:

  -  Triggering quiz-related utterances
  -  Submitting correct and incorrect answers
    - Verifying response accuracy
    - Ensuring smooth progression through quiz questions

---

### Presentation and Demonstration

- As part of the project deliverables, we:

    - Prepared a short presentation explaining Amazon Lex and chatbot functionality
    - Conducted a live demonstration of the quiz chatbot
    - Explained the technical approach, challenges encountered, and solutions applied

- This strengthened our ability to communicate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.

--- 

### Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience with Amazon Lex and conversational AI. By building both a basic chatbot and a quiz-based chatbot, we demonstrated our ability to design structured conversations, implement conditional logic, and deliver a practical solution aligned with real-world educational use cases.
