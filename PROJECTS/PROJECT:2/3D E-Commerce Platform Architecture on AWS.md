### 1. Introduction
- This document explains the AWS architecture designed to support a next-generation 3D
e-commerce web application. The platform must be globally available, highly scalable,
secure, fast, and cost-efficient while rendering 3D models to millions of users. Below is
a breakdown of the AWS services selected, why they were chosen, and how the final
solution meets all business and technical requirements.

### 2.AWS Services

### 1. Amazon S3 – Storage for 3D Assets

Amazon S3 is used to store all 3D product models, textures, images, and static website
assets.
### Why chosen:.

• Highly durable (11 9’s durability)

• Scales automatically for millions of asset requests

• Integrates directly with CloudFront for low-latency delivery

• Cost-effective object storage

### 2. Amazon CloudFront – Global CDN for Content Delivery

- CloudFront caches 3D assets, images, and website static files across global edge locations.
### Why chosen:
• Reduces latency for global users

• Protects the backend using AWS Shield and WAF integration

• Improves performance for heavy 3D content

• Decreases S3 and backend load

### 3. EC2 Auto Scaling / AWS Lambda – Backend Compute
The backend API can be built using either:
• EC2 Auto Scaling for applications requiring long-running processes

• AWS Lambda for event-driven API logic (serverless)

### Why chosen:
• Supports unpredictable spikes in traffic

• Load adjusts automatically up or down

• Reduces cost by only paying for what is used

• Lambda improves scalability and removes server maintenance

### 4. Amazon RDS / DynamoDB – User & Product Database
The architecture uses:
• RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL) for structured data like orders, users, and transactions.

• DynamoDB for fast product lookups and real-time inventory access

### Why chosen:
• RDS provides strong consistency & relational queries.

• DynamoDB offers millisecond latency for product browsing.

• Both scale easily and integrate with Lambda/EC2.

### 5. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) – Traffic Distribution

- The ALB (Application Load Balancer) distributes user requests across EC2 instances or Lambda functions.
  
### Why chosen:
• Provides health checks and fault tolerance

• Supports path-based routing (important for API and asset endpoints)

• Ensures high availability and automatic failover

### 6. Amazon Route 53 – Domain & DNS Management
- Route 53 manages the domain and routes traffic to CloudFront or ELB.
- 
### Why chosen:
• Highly available DNS service

• Supports health checks and routing policies

• Integrates well with CloudFront for global performance

### 7. CloudWatch & Trusted Advisor – Monitoring& Optimization
- These services monitor logs, application performance, and system metrics.
  
### Why chosen:
• CloudWatch provides real-time alerts, metrics, and dashboards.

• Trusted Advisor helps reduce cost, improve security, and detect misconfigurations.

• Ensures the platform remains reliable and optimized.

### 3. How The Architecture Meets

### Requirements

### 1. High Availability
• Route 53 + CloudFront provide multi-region distribution

• ELB supports auto failover.

• EC2 Auto Scaling ensures instances are replaced automatically.

• S3 provides 99.99% availability for assets.

### 2. Scalability
• Auto Scaling handles unpredictable traffic spikes

• DynamoDB offers on-demand scaling.

• CloudFront caches content globally, reducing backend load.

• Lambda automatically scales to thousands of requests per second.

### 3. Performance
• CloudFront drastically reduces latency for 3D models

• DynamoDB provides single-digit millisecond reads

• EC2 instances or Lambda functions process API requests quickly

• S3 ensures fast retrieval for large 3D assets

### 4. Security
• AWS WAF on CloudFront blocks malicious traffic

• IAM roles restrict resource access

• Security groups protect EC2 instances

• RDS has encryption, backups, and Multi-AZ deployment

• S3 supports bucket policies and encryption

### 5. Cost Optimization
• S3 and CloudFront reduce expensive compute usage

• Auto Scaling prevents over-provisioning

• Lambda eliminates server idle cost

• Trusted Advisor recommends savings opportunities

• DynamoDB on-demand mode reduces unnecessary database cost

### 4. Design Trade-Offs or Challenges
- Challenge 1: Handling large 3D model files
- Solution: Compress assets, use CloudFront caching, and enable S3 Transfer Acceleration.
  
- Challenge 2: Balancing cost and performance
- Solution: Use Lambda for low-traffic periods and EC2 Auto Scaling for peak hours.
  
- Challenge 3: Managing two databases (RDS + DynamoDB)
- Solution: Use RDS for transactional consistency (orders) and DynamoDB for high-speedreads (products).
- This hybrid approach ensures both performance and structure.
  
### CONCLUSION
- This AWS architecture fully supports a global 3D e-commerce platform by delivering
high availability, speed, scalability, security, and cost-efficiency. The selected AWS
services work together to create a modern, reliable infrastructure capable of serving
millions of users.
