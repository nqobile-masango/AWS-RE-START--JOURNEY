### About Taste of Africa
### • Overview:
Taste of Africa is a local restaurant that brings together
authentic African dishes, rich flavors, and warm
hospitality. The restaurant celebrates African culture
through its food and dining experience.
### • Operations:
The business receives a high volume of customer
bookings and orders every day, both in-person and by
phone. However, the manual paper-based system has led
to confusion, double bookings, and lost orders.
### • Purpose of the Project:
To introduce a simple AWS-hosted website that helps
customers make online bookings and orders reducing
errors, improving efficiency, and enhancing the overall
experience.

## - Challenges
### • Manual System
The restaurant still uses paper and phone
bookings, which often leads to confusion and
mix-ups.
### • Frequent Errors
Orders get lost or duplicated, and double
bookings happen because there’ s no online
record system.
### • No Centralized Data
Customer information and preferences aren’ t
stored anywhere, making it hard to identify
repeat customers.
### • Expensive to Scale
Managing more customers means hiring extra
staff or buying new computers both costly and
time-consuming.

### Project Goal
### - Main Goal:
- To design and host a
simple, user-friendly
website for
using Amazon
S3.
### Objectives:
- Replace the manual
paper system with an
online booking and
ordering platform.
- Reduce order mix-ups
and double bookings
through digital tracking.
- Improve efficiency and
customer experience
using cloud technology.
Demonstrate how AWS
can provide a low-cost,
scalable solution for
small businesses.

### Website Features
### • Home Page:
- Introduces with a
short description, slogan, and
welcoming images.
### • Menu Page:
- Displays dishes, prices, and meal
photos so customers can easily
browse.
### • Booking Page:
Includes a simple online form for
customers to make table
reservations.
### • Contact Page:
- Shows contact details, location, and
a message box for inquiries.
### • Design Style:
- Uses African-inspired colors brown,
gold, and white for a warm and
mode.

### AWS Services Used
### Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):

- Used to host our static website
and store images, CSS, and
HTML files.
- It makes the site accessible to
customers anytime, without a
traditional server.
### IAM (Identity and Access Management):
- Used to create and manage
user permissions safely.
- Helps ensure only authorized
users can edit or upload website files.
### CloudWatch:
- Used to monitor website
availability and performance for
future improvements.

### Benefits of AWS
### Low Cost
- AWS Free Tier allows
the restaurant to host
the website at almost
no cost.
### Reliability
- The site stays available
24/7, giving customers
constant access to
bookings and menus.
### Security
- IAM ensures only
authorized users can
manage the website
files.
### Scalability
- As the business grows,
AWS can easily handle
more traffic without
extra hardware.
### Simplicity
- AWS services are easy
to use and reduce the
need for technical staff.

### Cost Comparison
| **Feature / Expense** | **Manual System (Old Way)**                     | **AWS Cloud (New Way)**             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **System Setup**      | Requires computers, paper records, and software | Free to host using AWS S3 Free Tier |
| **Maintenance**       | Needs IT support and upgrades                   | No maintenance required             |
| **Data Storage**      | Kept in files or on local computers             | Stored securely in the cloud        |
| **Accessibility**     | Only in-store                                   | Accessible online anytime           |
| **Cost**              | High and ongoing                                | Very low and pay-as-you-go          |
