### 📘 AWS SimuLearn: Networking Concepts
- Awarded on 03 December 2025

### Overview:
AWS SimuLearn: Networking Concepts helped me understand how networking works in the AWS Cloud. I learned about key components like VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds), subnets, internet gateways, route tables, and security groups. These tools allow you to control how resources connect to each other and to the internet securely and efficiently.
