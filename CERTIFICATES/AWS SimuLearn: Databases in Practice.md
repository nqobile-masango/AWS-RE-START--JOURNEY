### 📘 AWS SimuLearn: Databases in Practice
- Awarded on 03 December 2025 Overview:

- AWS SimuLearn: Databases in Practice taught me the basics of how databases work in the cloud. I learned the difference between relational (like Amazon RDS) and non-relational (like DynamoDB) databases, when to use each, and how AWS helps manage them for better performance, security, and scalability.
