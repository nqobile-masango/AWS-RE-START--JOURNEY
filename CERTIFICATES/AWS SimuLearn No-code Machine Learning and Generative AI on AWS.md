### 📘 No-code Machine Learning and Generative AI on AWS
--- 
Awarded on 11 December 2025

### Overview:

- I learned how to use Amazon SageMaker Canvas to prepare data, build, train, and deploy machine learning models without writing code or having prior ML experience.
- I built models for tabular and time-series data and worked with foundation models to support generative AI use cases such as text generation, summarization, and chat using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
