Awarded on 11 December 2025
###  OVERVIEW
- In this course,I explored the generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) application lifecycle, which includes defining a business use case, selecting a foundation model (FM), improving the performance of an FM, evaluating the performance of an FM, and deployment and its impact on business objectives. 
- This course is a primer to generative AI courses, which dive deeper into concepts related to customizing an FM using prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning.
