### 📘 AWS SimuLearn: File Systems in the Cloud
- Awarded on 04 December 2025

### Overview:

-  AWS SimuLearn: File Systems in the Cloud introduced me to how AWS handles file storage using services like Amazon EFS and Amazon FSx. I learned how cloud-based file systems support shared access, scalability, and durability, making it easier to store and access files from multiple EC2 instances efficiently.
