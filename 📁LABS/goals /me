Here’s a summary for Windows users to connect to an Amazon Linux EC2 instance via SSH using PuTTY:

Windows – SSH to EC2 Instance

Open the "Details" dropdown in your lab.

Click "Show" to reveal the credentials.

Download the .ppk file (e.g., labuser.ppk).

Note the Public IP Address of the EC2 instance.

Download and install PuTTY if you don't have it [from the official site].

Open putty.exe.

In PuTTY:

Go to Session tab.

In Host Name, enter:
ec2-user@<Public-IP> (replace <Public-IP> with actual address)

Go to Connection > SSH > Auth.

Under Private key file for authentication, browse and select the .ppk file.

Click Open to start the SSH session.

You're now authenticated as ec2-user into your EC2 Linux instance.
