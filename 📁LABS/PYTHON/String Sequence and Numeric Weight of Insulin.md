- Wait until status shows `ready`, then close the panel.

- Open AWS Management Console (auto login).

- Navigate to **Services** > **Cloud9** and open the environment card `reStart-python-cloud9`.

- Handle pop-ups by choosing **Discard** or **No** when prompted.

### 📂 Creating Your Python File

- Save as `hello-world.py in /home/ec2-user/environment`.

### 💻 Accessing the Terminal

- Open a new terminal session.

- Use `pwd` to confirm directory `(/home/ec2-user/environment)`.

### Check Python versions with:

- `python --version`

- `python2 --version`

- `python3 --version`

### 🐍 Exercise 1: Introducing Python

- Python is a high-level, general-purpose language.

- Two major releases: **2.x**and **3.x.**

###⚡ Challenges
- Initial setup required careful attention to pop-up blockers and browser permissions.

- Remembering to save the file in the correct directory (`/home/ec2-user/environment`).

- Distinguishing between different Python versions and ensuring the correct one (3.6.x) was used.

- Navigating the Cloud9 IDE menus **(File > New From Template > Python File)** could be confusing for beginners.

- Handling unexpected pop-up messages like `.c9/project.settings changed `or third-party content prompts.
