### ✅ Completing the Lab

- Select End Lab and confirm.

System deletes resources and displays **Ended AWS Lab Successfully**.

### 🏆 Wins

- Successfully set up and accessed the **AWS Cloud9 IDE** environment.

- Learned how to **create and save a Python file** `(hello-world.py)` in the correct directory.

-  Practiced using the **terminal to check Python versions (`python, python2, python3`).

- Understood the difference between **Python 2.x and 3.x** and why the lab uses **Python 3.6.x**.

- Wrote and executed the classic **Hello, World program**, confirming the environment works correctly.

- Gained confidence in navigating the **AWS Management Console** and handling pop-ups.

- Completed the lab within the estimated time frame (45 minutes).

###⚡ Challenges
- Initial setup required careful attention to pop-up blockers and browser permissions.

- Remembering to save the file in the correct directory (`/home/ec2-user/environment`).

- Distinguishing between different Python versions and ensuring the correct one (3.6.x) was used.

- Navigating the Cloud9 IDE menus **(File > New From Template > Python File)** could be confusing for beginners.

- Handling unexpected pop-up messages like `.c9/project.settings changed `or third-party content prompts.

- Understanding backward compatibility and syntax differences between Python 2.x and 3.x might feel overwhelming at first.

- Ending the lab correctly to ensure resources were deleted without issues.
